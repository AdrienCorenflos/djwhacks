## Scala library for Bayesian computation - pMCMC algorithms for Markov processes

Uses "sbt" for building - build file in this directory.
A default sbt installation should "compile", "test" and "run" code.
Code relies heavily on "breeze".

This code is EXPERIMENTAL ABANDONWARE. It is not intended for general use.

However, I am open-sourcing all of the code in this directory and all subdirectories of this directory under an Apache license, for the benefit of some students who would like to use it as part of their Masters project.
