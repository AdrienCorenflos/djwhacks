"bayeskit"

Scala library for Bayesian computation - especially SMC and pMCMC algorithms for Markov processes

Uses "sbt" for building - build file in this directory.
A default sbt installation should build, test and run code.
Code relies heavily on "breeze".

This code is EXPERIMENTAL. It is not yet for general use.

TODO
----
Reading LV data from file.
Try unwrapping code from objects.
Investigate better/alternative "sample" functions - sorting weights - Walker's alias method, etc.
More numerically stable filtering using log-weights?
Simulating arbitrary SPN models.
Parsing SBML models into SPN simulators.
Hook to Java-based SBML simulator.
