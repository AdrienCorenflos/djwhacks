"bayeskit"

Scala library for Bayesian computation - especially SMC and pMCMC algorithms for Markov processes

Uses "sbt" for building - build file in this directory.
A default sbt installation should "compile", "test" and "run" code.
Code relies heavily on "breeze".

This code is EXPERIMENTAL. It is not yet for general use.
