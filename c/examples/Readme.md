# Some simple C examples for beginners

In increasing order of complexity:

* [e.c](e.c) - compute e from its series expansion
* [prime.c](prime.c) - test if a number (provided as a command line arg) is prime
* [factor.c](factor.c) - factor a number into its prime factors
* [sqrt.c](sqrt.c) - square root a number using Newton's method

## Some ideas for extra examples

* Sin via recursion
* Dereferenced typdefed structs...
* A simple canvas drawing app, with a bunch of examples (sierpinski triangles, menger sponge, fractal trees, GoL, Langton's ant, etc.), but just writing image to disk
* Using an external library - eg. an image library?
* Very basic Gtk application - eg. rendering an image in a window?
