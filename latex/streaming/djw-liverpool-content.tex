\protect\hypertarget{streaming-data-architecture}{}

\begin{block}{Fundamental concepts}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \emph{stream} is a (possibly infinite) sequence of values of a given
  (potentially complex) data type, with a definite order
\item
  The stream is accessed one value at a time, and processing is done
  incrementally, triggered by the arrival of each value
\item
  Typically only \emph{one pass} over the data is possible
\item
  Streams are connected together in a DAG called the \emph{flow graph}
\end{itemize}

\end{block}

\begin{block}{Software libraries and frameworks}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Storm}, \emph{Heron}, \emph{Spark streaming}, \emph{Akka
  streams}, \emph{Flink}, \emph{Kafka streams} are well-known examples
  of streaming data frameworks
\item
  Frameworks are often run on the \emph{JVM}, built in languages with
  good support for \textbf{functional programming} (FP), such as
  \emph{Scala}, and rely to a greater-or-lesser extent on FP principles
  such as \emph{functional reactive programming} (FRP)
\end{itemize}

\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Functional models of streaming data}
\protect\hypertarget{functional-models-of-streaming-data}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A key streaming data processing abstraction is a pure
  \textbf{function}:
  \[h: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y} \longrightarrow \mathcal{X}\]
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{advance: (State, Observation) => State}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

combining current world knowledge (encapsulated in a \texttt{State})
together with the latest observation to get an updated world view

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Then given
  \(x_0\in\mathcal{X},\quad \mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}^{\mathbb{N}}\)
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{s0: State, sObs: Stream[Observation]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

we transform the stream of observations \(\mathbf{y}\) to states
\(\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}^{\mathbb{N}}\):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sState: Stream[State] = sObs.}\FunctionTok{scan}\NormalTok{(s0)(advance)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

via successive application of \(h\).

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Stream transformation}
\protect\hypertarget{stream-transformation}{}

Streams are \emph{functors}, since they \texttt{map}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{  Stream[A].}\FunctionTok{map}\NormalTok{[B](f: A => B): Stream[B]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{scan} operation, sometimes called \texttt{scanLeft}, has
signature:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{  scanLeft[B](init: B)(advance: (B, A) => B): Stream[B]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{val}\NormalTok{ naturals = Stream.}\FunctionTok{iterate}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)(_ + }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}

\KeywordTok{val}\NormalTok{ evens = naturals }\FunctionTok{map}\NormalTok{ (_ * }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{State-space modelling}
\protect\hypertarget{state-space-modelling}{}

In state-space modelling, we have a

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  forward model: \(X_t | x_{t-1} \sim f(x_t|x_{t-1})\) or
  \texttt{f:\ X\ =\textgreater{}\ P{[}X{]}}
\item
  and observation model: \(Y_t|x_t \sim g(y_t|x_t)\) or
  \texttt{g:\ X\ =\textgreater{}\ P{[}Y{]}}
\end{itemize}

where \texttt{P{[}\_{]}} is a suitable \emph{probability monad}, and
\(f\), \(g\) are \emph{Markov kernels}.

For \emph{filtering} we typically think in terms of predict-update
steps:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(p(x_{t-1}|\mathcal{Y}_{t-1}) \rightarrow p(x_t|\mathcal{Y}_{t-1})\)
  or \texttt{predict:\ P{[}X{]}\ =\textgreater{}\ P{[}X{]}}
\item
  \(p(x_t|\mathcal{Y}_{t-1}) \rightarrow p(x_t|\mathcal{Y}_t)\) or
  \texttt{update:\ (P{[}X{]},Y)\ =\textgreater{}\ P{[}X{]}}
\end{itemize}

\texttt{predict} is monadic \texttt{flatMap} (or
\texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}=}) with \texttt{f}, and
\texttt{update} is \emph{probabilistic conditioning} (Bayesian updating)
via \texttt{g}

Streaming:
\texttt{advance\ =\ update\ compose\ predict\textquotesingle{}} where
\texttt{State\ =\ P{[}X{]}} - eg. one step of a Kalman or particle
filter

\begin{frame}{Composable functional models of on-line algorithms and
PPLs}
\protect\hypertarget{composable-functional-models-of-on-line-algorithms-and-ppls}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Once we start to think about filtering in terms of operations
  involving probability monads and Markov kernels, it becomes easier to
  think about how to make models and algorithms composable and scalable,
  and about the connection to \emph{probabilistic programming} and
  monadic \emph{probabilistic programming languages} (PPLs)
\item
  Possible to think about all of the standard models and algorithms for
  SSMs within this framework: Kalman filters (regular, extended,
  unscented, ensemble, \ldots{}), particle filters (bootstrap, SIR,
  auxiliary, \ldots{}), etc.

\begin{frame}{POMP models}
\protect\hypertarget{pomp-models}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Classical SSMs assume that the data are on a regular equispaced time
  grid, so that the state evolution model \(f(x_t|x_{t-1},\theta)\)
  represents a single time step of the process
\item
  Many sensors and devices do not generate data on a regular grid,
  either by design, or due to crashes/reboots creating large gaps of
  missing values, pushing observations onto a \emph{misaligned grid}, or
  changes in sampling frequency, etc.
\item
  \textbf{Partially observed Markov process} (POMP) models generalise
  classical SSMs in two important ways:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The state evolution model formulated in \emph{continuous time}, and
    is described by a transition kernel \(f(x_{t+t'}|x_t,t',\theta)\)
  \item
    It is not (necessarily) required that the transition kernel can be
    \emph{evaluated} --- only that the state process can be
    stochastically \emph{simulated} forwards in time
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{On-line filtering of POMP models}
\protect\hypertarget{on-line-filtering-of-pomp-models}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The ``bootstrap'' particle filter is a ``likelihood free'' algorithm
  for sequentially computing the filtering distribution of a POMP model
  (for fixed \(\theta\)): \[
  \pi(x_t|\mathcal{Y}_t),\ \text{ where } \mathcal{Y}_t \equiv \{y_s|y_s\in\mathcal{Y},s\leq t\}
  \]
\item
  Although it is typically presented in discrete time, it works fine for
  continuous time processes observed discretely at irregular times
\item
  Additionally, composable (and tractable) families of continuous time
  transition kernels can be built using similar techniques as are
  sometimes used for discrete time DLMs

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Not all streaming data applications are about time series
\item
  Many are just about analysing data based on a single pass
\item
  Almost any statistical algorithm can be expressed in the form of a
  streaming data algorithm
\item
  All of the data observed so far can be embedded in the \emph{state},
  and any analysis whatsoever of the data can be restarted from scratch
  with the arrival of each new observation!
\item
  We wouldn't consider such an analysis to be \emph{genuinely} on-line
\item
  We typically assume that the ``size'' of the state is bounded, and
  that the computational ``complexity'' of the \emph{advance} step has
  bounded expectation

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\item

  state process facilitates the bounding of state size and computation

\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Spatio-temporal GPs}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Relatively straightforward to formulate GPs sequentially and embed in
  a streaming data framework
\item
  Most commonly used space-time covariance functions don't lead to
  simple Markov properties, so special techniques for ``scalable'' and
  ``streaming'' GPs must be used to ensure the algorithms are genuinely
  ``on-line''

\begin{itemize}

  The analysis and modelling of streaming data is becoming increasingly

  Typical motivations:

  \item
    Sequential analysis of ``live'' data in (near) real time
  \item
    Analysis of large data-sets based on ``one pass'' methods
  \item
    Parallel computation via stream \emph{splitting} and \emph{merging}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  There exist computational models and software libraries for working
  with streaming data in an efficient and robust way
\item
  Functional (and reactive) programming languages and approaches are
  well-suited to working with (infinite) data streams (and probabilistic
  programs)
\item
  Time series are a natural fit to streaming data models, but not all
  streaming data applications have a natural temporal aspect
\item
  Many statistical models and algorithms can be adapted to a sequential
