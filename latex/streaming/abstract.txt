Streaming data modelling for real-time monitoring and forecasting

A key challenge of modern data science is the development of scalable
algorithms for extracting useful information from large, complex,
heterogeneous and ever-growing data sets in (near) real-time. A
promising approach is to combine sequential statistical modelling with
computational frameworks for streaming data processing, making
significant use of functional programming approaches. This talk will
introduce some of the basic concepts, and illustrate the techniques in
the context of real-time urban flood forecasting. Fusion of highly
non-Gaussian point and areal spatial data from environmental sensors
provides a challenging use case for on-line statistical modelling.

## Abstract for Turing project presentation (November 2021):

Streaming data modelling for real-time monitoring and forecasting

This project is addressing a key challenge of modern data science: the
development of scalable algorithms for extracting useful information
from large, complex, heterogeneous and ever-growing data sets in
(near) real-time. The project combines sequential statistical
modelling with computational frameworks for streaming data processing,
making significant use of functional programming approaches. The
techniques will be illustrated using live streaming data from
Newcastle’s Urban Observatory – one of the largest public sources of
smart-city data in the world. Data from environmental sensors which
are both multivariate and spatially distributed provide a challenging
use case for on-line statistical modelling.
