# The NUFEB project

* NUFEB: *Newcastle University Frontiers in Engineering Biology*
* `research.ncl.ac.uk/nufeb/`
* £5.5M EPSRC Frontiers in Engineering award
* Roughly 12 investigators at Newcastle, across Engineering, Maths & Stats, Computing Science, similar number of RAs
* Collaboration with *Northumbrian Water* --- `www.nwl.co.uk`
* Project title:

**A new frontier in design:**

**the simulation of open engineered biological systems**

* Concerned with the multi-scale stochastic simulation of complex biological communities in an open environmental system, with a view to using simulation for designing engineering interventions to improve performance
* Exemplar application: Wastewater treatment systems

# NUFEB exemplar: Wastewater treatment plants

* Wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) are an ideal example of a multi-scale open engineered biological system
* There are roughly $10^{18}$ individual bacteria in a typical plant
* Macro-scale characteristics of WTPs are the consequence of micro-scale features of a vast number of individual bacteria acting together in complex ecological communities
* The properties of cells at the micro-scale level dictate the behaviour of a WTP at the macro scale
* Need to model and understand the interaction of microbes at a fine scale to accurately capture micro-scale responses
* Need to transfer this fine-scale information to the engineered macroscale process in a computationally efficient way

# Two different water treatment technologies

Micro-scale modelling similar, but different up-scaling strategies

*From Wikipedia:*

## Activated sludge systems

Treating wastewater in large tanks using aeration and a biological floc composed of bacteria and protozoa

## Trickling filter

Consists of a fixed bed of rocks, lava, coke, gravel, or plastic, or other media over which sewage or other wastewater flows downward and causes a layer of microbial slime (biofilm) to grow, covering the bed of media

Aerobic conditions are maintained by splashing, diffusion, and usually by natural convection of air if the filter medium is porous

# Data and measurements for model validation and calibration

## Micro-scale

We have laboratory facilities for growing and measuring biological, chemical and mechanical properties of flocs and biofilms

## Bench-scale

We can run bench-scale experiments in chemostats and similar devices for testing our meso-scale upscaling

## Pilot plant

We also have a pilot plant facility for experiments at the macro-scale

# BE:WISE

**Biological Engineering: Wastewater Innovation at Scale**

* Pilot plant facility for model validation and testing
* The largest wastewater treatment research facility in Europe, developing innovations for sustainable wastewater treatment
* Funded by a £1.2 million grant from the EPSRC, and with funding from Newcastle University and Northumbrian Water, BE:WISE is an international centre of research excellence and demonstration for wastewater management technology
* The BE:WISE facility is made available to academic researchers worldwide.
